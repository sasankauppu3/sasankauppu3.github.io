This tool has been built and deployed as a web-based system using Java SpringBoot, Jenkins for Continuous Integration and deployed on AWS. <br>- Various Abstract syntax tree matching algorithms have been implemented for detecting plagiarism, and a gradient descent algorithm has been used on the outputs of the algorithms as a Machine Learning model to improve the plagiarism score prediction.
