                <div class="col-lg-8 exp-text"><ul>
                    <li>For a healthcare client, devised Covid-19 data lakes using audit tables for data validation with custom email alerts. Generated optimized and scalable data extracts on patient data of over hundred million records using Scala with Spark, Hadoop and Hive.</li>
                    <li>Constructed cost reduction, vendor consolidation tool using Django. Developed and deployed the tool with backend xgboost models onto GCP, allowing users to train-test with a goal to classify healthcare purchase orders, choose the optimal pricing options and reduce manual efforts with 87% accuracy.</li>
                    <li>For a pharmaceutical client, generated scalable feature engineering pipelines to create a 360 degree patient view using Airflow and PySpark. Conducted hypothesis driven testing at a patient/drug level over clusters to help client better target the right population. Built Uplift models to test various health plans with a goal to identify the success rates across treatment groups, improve adherence and scripts.</li>
                    <li>Created Data cleaning framework for in-house ML package with end to end testing. Built pipelines to auto deploy transformation models onto MLFlow for reusability, optimizing the build times by ~ 30%.</li>
                    <li>Initiated internal AI hackathon for practitioners across the firm. Contributed in University related recruiting info session talks, studio jams and career fair events.</li>
