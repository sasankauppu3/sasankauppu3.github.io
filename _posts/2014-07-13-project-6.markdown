course: Artificial Intelligence
description: <br>Incorporated different Artificial Intelligent methods on the Pac-Man using Python on the Berkley course project. Different phases in the project are discussed as below:<br>- Implemented different Search algorithms(such as DFS, BFS, A* heuristics etc) to help Pacman navigate in the maze.<br>- Used adversarial and stochastic search problems to build minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions for Pacman to identify ghosts.<br>- Built model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms along with Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model.<br>- Implemented standard machine learning classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Perceptron to implement a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
