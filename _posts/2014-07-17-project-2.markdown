course: Unsupervised Machine Learning 
description: <br>This is a part of Unsupervised Machine Learning Coursework. <br>- Implemented clustering algorithms such as KNN, Kmeans, and Gaussian Mixture model etc.<br>- Analysed different feature selection algorithms along with Dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA and HAAR like features for Images.<br>- Worked on TensorfFlow AutoEncodings and Word Vectors along with Neural Nets and some supervised classification algorithms.<br>- Implemented Sampling techniques and Summarization, Topic Modeling for Texts. <br>- Worked on community detection in Social graphs and Recommender systems using collaborative filtering.<br>Few Datasets used include 20 NewsGroups, MNIST, UCI/Household Dataset, DUC 2001 summarization dataset, MovieLens 100K Ratings and Friendster Social Graph
